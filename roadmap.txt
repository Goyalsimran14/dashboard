o	1NF, 2NF, 3NF, BCNF, and higher normal forms
o	De-normalization techniques and their trade-offs
•	Keys and Constraints:
o	Primary Keys, Foreign Keys, Unique Constraints
o	CHECK, DEFAULT, and NOT NULL constraints
o	Composite Keys and their use
•	Entity-Relationship Models (ER Models):
o	Translating ER Diagrams to SQL schema
o	Relationships between tables: One-to-Many, Many-to-Many, One-to-One
📚 Resources:
•	Book: Database Design for Mere Mortals by Michael J. Hernandez

🚀 Phase 4: SQL Query Optimization and Advanced Techniques (Week 6-7)
🧠 What to Learn:
•	Query Optimization Techniques:
o	Indexing: Types of indexes (B-tree, Bitmap, Hash)
o	Query Execution Plan (EXPLAIN keyword in SQL)
o	Optimizing complex joins and subqueries
•	Advanced Data Manipulation:
o	MERGE statement (for UPSERT operations)
o	Batch Inserts and Bulk Data Operations
o	Optimizing INSERT INTO SELECT queries
•	Partitioning and Sharding:
o	Horizontal vs. Vertical Partitioning
o	Range Partitioning, List Partitioning, Hash Partitioning
o	Distributed Databases: Sharding data for scalability
📚 Resources:
•	Book: SQL Performance Tuning by Peter Gulutzan and Trudy Pelzer
•	SQL Server Performance Blog - Excellent for SQL performance tips
📈 Practice:
•	Optimize a slow-running query and test the performance using EXPLAIN (in MySQL/PostgreSQL)
•	Participate in optimization challenges on Hackerrank's SQL Performance Challenges

🌍 Phase 5: Working with Large Datasets and Advanced Topics (Week 7-8)
🧠 What to Learn:
•	Handling Large Datasets:
o	Querying and handling large tables (using LIMIT, OFFSET, and BULK operations)
o	Using TEMPORARY tables
o	Querying with joins and subqueries on massive datasets
•	Stored Procedures and Triggers:
o	Writing and managing stored procedures and functions
o	Triggers for automated data processing
o	Using BEGIN and END to group multiple SQL commands
•	Database Transactions and Concurrency:
o	BEGIN TRANSACTION, COMMIT, ROLLBACK
o	ACID properties and Isolation Levels (READ COMMITTED, SERIALIZABLE, etc.)
📚 Resources:
•	Book: SQL in 10 Minutes by Ben Forta (for quick tips and techniques)
•	SQL Server Documentation - For advanced SQL Server features like Transactions, Triggers, and Procedures
📈 Practice:
•	Implement Triggers and Stored Procedures in a database (e.g., automatically update stock quantity in an e-commerce database)
•	Optimize queries on large data using indexing and partitioning
________________________________________
🧠 Final Project (Week 8)
Project Idea:
•	Build a Data Warehouse System:
o	Design a system that handles ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes.
o	Work with data from multiple sources (CSV, JSON) and load it into normalized tables.
o	Use stored procedures, functions, and triggers to automate data processing.
o	Optimize large datasets using indexing, partitioning, and query optimization techniques.
